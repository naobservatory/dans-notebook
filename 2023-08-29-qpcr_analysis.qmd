## Objectives

- Compare several wastewater filtering options by measuring the nucleic acid content by qPCR. [TODO: Link to experimental design]
- Get Dan up to speed with working with this data.
- Explore options for data analysis workflows.

## Preliminary work

- Ari put the `.eds` files into Google Drive from the lab computer. (He also exported some Excel files but we're not using those.)
- Dan installed the Google Drive desktop app and Design and Analysis on his Mac, opened the `.eds` files, and fixed some missing data in the plate layout
- Dan used the "Analyze" in Design and Analysis to automatically calculate thresholds and compute `c_q` values.
- Dan exported the data to `.csv`.
